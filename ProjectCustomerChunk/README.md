## 📊 Model Interpretation

| Churn Probability | Risk Level | Action              |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ------------------- |
| 0–30%             | 🟢 Low     | No action needed    |
| 30–60%            | 🟡 Medium  | Monitor & engage    |
| 60–100%           | 🔴 High    | Immediate retention |

**Example Output**

```
Not Churn: 74.3%
Churn: 25.7%
Risk Level: Low
```
